Stress can have a detrimental effect on your productivity, creativity, and overall performance. When you experience high levels of stress, it can lead to:

* **Lower Energy Levels:** Chronic stress can drain your energy reserves, leaving you feeling fatigued and less motivated to tackle your responsibilities.

* **Impaired Decision Making:** Excessive stress can cloud your judgment and impair your ability to make sound decisions, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.

* **Weakened Health and Well-being:** Prolonged exposure to stress can negatively affect your physical and mental well-being, leading to decreased resilience and increased risk of burnout.

By implementing stress reduction techniques, you can mitigate these negative effects and regain control over your productivity and overall well-being.
